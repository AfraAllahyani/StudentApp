# Student Applicaton 
This code is written to take the students name and grades ( with no specific number) add them in the system .
Also check if there are students have the same grade .

- master :
used Resizing Array to add students in an array, but this is going to affect Memory usage bad.

update it
- main (branch) :
using list which is more efficient and proper use in this situation.
